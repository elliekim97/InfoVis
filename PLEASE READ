The file will not open properly unless you set up a local host on your computer's terminal.

Open terminal and enter:
cd <where the file is located> (for e.g. /Users/yourname/Desktop)
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8888


Afterwards, type in "localhost:8888" on your browser (Chrome works best) and enter.

You will then see the graph on your web browser.
